        <p>My midterm project was focused on death in nature, particularly among plant life. I emphasized beige, red, and overall more dull hues to convey the emotion behind my theme. For my final project, there were a couple of things I wanted to build on from my previous set of photos. I wanted to focus on a theme that would provide a contrast to the previous one, so I focused on budding plant life around Colorado - “life in the mountains” as opposed to “death in the desert”. Initially I thought I would stay with the same thing, but the time of year is just perfect for life and there were so many little gems blooming around Boulder.
        </p>
        <p>Another thing I wanted to expand upon from my previous project was close-up shots: I really, really enjoyed how my more intimate shots from Moab and the Grand Canyon turned out and wanted to make more of an effort to take close-up shots with more shallow depth of field. Since the signs of life are still smaller right now, and it took effort to scout out tiny small flowers, this style of photography fit the project perfectly.</p>
        <p>In general I wanted to highlight the diversity of plant life in the mountains and I think I did a good job of doing so. The amount of colors, and small things you can find in nature is just fantastic and I wanted this project to serve as inspiration to pay attention to the smaller things in nature. Often we pay attention to the big picture when in the wilderness, and while that’s also quite beautiful I find it rewarding to seek out the pieces of the natural world which usually evade us. Looking for those small sprouts of life was a challenge, and some of them ended up being beautiful compositions which provided a good dichotomy with my midterm while still being thematically related.</p>

        <p>Coming into this project, I struggled with coming up with a central theme that I wanted to tie my work around. I was initially interested in a reflective project centered around the theme of nostalgia and times past, but ultimately decided that theme would be better suited to a personal project. Knowing that I would be in Moab, Utah and the Grand Canyon in Arizona I directed my focus before I left towards themes that could be explored in that desert environment—which is a really, really fascinating place and a fantastic location to take photos at due to the wide, open landscapes and vivid colors. After giving more thought to what concept I wanted to explore with this project, I settled on exploring the themes of life and death in the context of the desert. </p>
        <p>The desert is a really special area to explore the themes of life and death, as it’s an incredibly harsh environment. It’s comparable to, albeit on the opposite end of, the arctic, which I think a project on would provide an equally compelling exploration of this theme. You’re struck, once you get there, at how barren it all is. The plant life that does survive consists of mangled trees and hardy little bushes, and fauna encompasses the occasional scorpion or beetle and some crows and hawks. What fascinated me and ultimately ended up being the core of my photography series was how many dead, mangled plant corpses lay everywhere across the deserts of Utah and Arizona. The desert is so vast, and provided endless opportunities to explore my theme further. Most of the photos were taken over the course of my time in Utah (3 days) and a few were taken in Arizona.</p>
        <p>I wanted to emphasize with my photography that there is an element of beauty in death. I found it poetic that although so much plant life in the area was dead, it wasn’t gone—it remained in the desert, and part of the ecosystem in a way, long after the life in it was sapped away. The life in the desert seemed to be in a constant battle of resistance: from the scorpions to the sun-baked bushes hanging on to dear life, you get a real impression of just how hardy life can be. Although death littered the landscape, life finds a way even in these conditions. That all being said, I found this environment truly exceptional in terms of exploring this theme and was quite moved by the landscape and scenery in the area which I hadn’t really gotten to see before. I’m very excited to further explore life and death in the context of the Colorado environment in my final project.</p>

        <p>I went on a weekend trip with friends recently to Ouray, Colorado—about 5 hours down south from Boulder. We went to go climb in a man-made “ice park”, which would mark my first time trying ice climbing. I knew this would be a great opportunity to take photos for this assignment, so I rented a camera to bring. The Ouray Ice Park is a man-made area, but it looks like part of nature—flowing frozen waterfalls, a large valley full of ice. I wanted to document the intersection between humans and nature.</p>

        <p>What I found really intriguing about the environment of the Ouray Ice Park was that you can’t necessarily tell where nature ends and human work begins. It’s this delicate balance between the two—of course not all the ice and snow is man-made, but it’s maintained by workers and sprinklers go off every night to create more ice and maintain the existing ice. I wanted to include pictures of more obvious evidence that humankind has touched this place—glimpses of structures contrasted with the nature around them, but also pictures of just the icy wonderland environment. I found these to be really compelling as they present evidence of humans, but that evidence isn’t apparent or obvious at first glance. In fact, it might not be evident at all without the context. Ice structures can form in nature as well, and it’s hard to spot that it’s man-made without the additional context of the infrastructure around Ouray. </p>
        
        <p>In general I think Ouray is a really interesting place to photograph as the contrast between humans and nature is very apparent there and makes the evidence most obvious.</p>

        <p>In this photography project, I aimed to capture the motion and beauty of Boulder Creek in the morning as it flowed through my neighborhood. It's typically the trail I run on, but today I went with a different angle. The movement of the water and the ducks swimming in the river are the main subjects, representing the fluidity and grace of nature. Through the camera, I sought to showcase the calming and serene nature of the creek and its inhabitants, highlighting the tranquility it provides through its movement. As a photographer, I am drawn to the natural world and find inspiration in capturing it. This project is a testament to the creek and my passion for capturing the beauty of the natural world through my photography.</p>
