    <h3 style="color:#2D6A4F">Q: What's your favorite documentary?</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>A: </strong> 
    My favorite documentary of all time is probably the film <i>The King of Kong</i>. The documentary follows two pro Donkey Kong players,
    Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe, in their quest for domination over the game's high score. It's such a ridiculous concept but the people
    involved really treat it as a way of life and the documentary captures these people so well. Billy Mitchell makes a great villain.

    <h3 style="color:#2D6A4F">Q: What kind of work do you enjoy?</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>A: </strong> 
    I like working on video editing projects, particularly on documentaries or real-life stories. Part of the fun is going and experiencing
    whatever you might be documenting. For instance, I followed my friends who rock climb for 16 hours and got footage of them competing in
    a competition. It was fun to create a video around that, but the actual work of following that story was 75% of the job!

    <h3 style="color:#2D6A4F">Q: What do you like to do in your free time?</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>A: </strong> 
    I like to read, hike, work out, and spend time with friends typically in my free time. I used to be more of a video game player, but they
    don't tend to hold my interest for super long anymore. If I do pick up a game it'll be Pokemon - I love me some Pokemon. Always have.
    I also love to watch the reality TV show Survivor. Definitely my guilty pleasure, but I'm not that guilty about it since I genuinely think
    it's a great TV show!
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#2D6A4F">Q: What's your favorite snack?</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>A: </strong> 
    I really enjoy the Jalepeno & Cream Cheese Wontons you can get from Target. I'm talking about the name brand Good & Gather wontons.
    Sounds like a paid advertisement but sadly Target is not paying me to say this. In fact, I'm in the hole about 8 dollars more every time
    I buy them. It's worth it, though. They're really good. I enjoy them.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#2D6A4F">Q: What's your favorite book?</h3>

    <p>
    <strong>A: </strong> 
    As of recently, my favorite book I've read is "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer. It documents the horrifying disaster on Mount Everest
    in 1996, which Krakauer was on the expedition for. It was a deeply profound and moving book, and really put the dangers of mountaineering
    into perspective. It made me think more deeply about mortality than usual - very touching and impactful story as well as a really
    well-written account of the events that unfolded.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#1B4332">That's all for now! Thanks!</h3>
