    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    
    <div class="main-3">
    <p>My name is Casey McCollum. I grew up in Denver, Colorado and am currently enrolled in school at the University of Colorado, Boulder. As a kid I loved to play games and create stories, and was enthusiastic even from a young age about making art and editing videos (I wanted to be a Youtuber). Today I've maintained those same interests, although I like to think I've picked up more skills along the journey. Primarily I like to do video work, but I am also interested by graphic design. To get to know me a bit better, here's some photos of me. </p>

    <ul class="photos">

    <p>At the moment this website exists as an assignment for my college class ATLS 2200 (Web). Of course, someday soon I hope to turn it into a genuine personal website! This is the beta stage, and I hope you stick around to see more.</p>
