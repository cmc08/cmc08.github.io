        My name is Casey McCollum. I grew up in Denver, Colorado and am currently enrolled in school at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
        As a kid I loved to play games and create stories, and was enthusiastic even from a young age about making art and editing videos
        (I wanted to be a Youtuber). Today I've maintained those same interests, although I like to think I've picked up more skills along
        the journey. Primarily I like to do video work, but I am also interested by graphic design. To get to know me a bit better, here's
        some photos of me.
    </p>

    </ul>

        At the moment this website exists as an assignment for my college class ATLS 2200 (Web). Of course, someday soon I hope to turn it
        into a genuine personal website! This is the beta stage, and I hope you stick around to see more.
