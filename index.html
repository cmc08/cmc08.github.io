    <h3>My name is <span style="color:rgb(0, 141, 197)">Casey McCollum</span>. My pronouns are he/him.</h3>
    <p>I'm a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying <strong>Media Production</strong> in the College of Media, Communication, 
        and Information.</p>
    <p>My primary goals for this course are to <em>become competent in HTML and gain experience in Web design</em>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy going for hikes, hanging out with friends, watching good shows, reading, and a lot more. My favorite YouTube video is probably
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3-Y31ONZuI" title="YouTube">Thin Watermelon by Nathan Fielder.</a></p>
